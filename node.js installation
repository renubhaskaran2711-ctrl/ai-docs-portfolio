# Steps to Install Node.js

To publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry or a private npm registry, you must install Node.js and the npm command line interface using either a Node version manager or a Node installer. 

> We strongly recommend using a Node version manager like  [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)  to install Node.js and npm. 

## Using a Node version manager to install Node.js 

**Node version managers** allow you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm on your system so you can test your applications on multiple versions of npm to ensure they work for users on different versions.

> We do not recommend using a [Node installer](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), since the Node installation process installs npm in a directory with local permissions and can cause permissions errors when you run npm packages globally.
